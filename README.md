The output above has been produced while training using POS on Schaffer's F6 function. The function is given by :

## In case:
You get an error like 
```python
Keyword : 'u ffmpeg "
```
Then Install ffmpeg
```shell
$ sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
```
## Suggestion
Use Jupyter Notebook.

Thanks to the original creater [Pradeep](https://gist.github.com/btbytes/79877/02db146894aeab3fffa44c0ca84c121c3ecc441e). I have merely created a wrapper for visualization and quadratic function.
