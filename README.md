# Particle-Swarm-Implementation-in-Python
A naive implementation of Particle Swarm Optimisation in Python with Animation of Swarms.

![Animation of Swarms](https://github.com/singh-hrituraj/Particle-Swarm-Implementation-in-Python/raw/master/Animation.gif)

The output above has been produced while training using POS on Schaffer's F6 function. The function is given by :

## In case:
You get an error like 
```python
Keyword : 'u ffmpeg "
```
Then Install ffmpeg
```shell
$ sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
```

The credit for the original implementation goes to [Pradeep Gowda](https://gist.github.com/btbytes/79877). I have merely created a wrapper to show visualisation.
